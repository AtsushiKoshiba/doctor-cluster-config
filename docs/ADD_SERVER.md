# Setting up new hosts

Here we assume `$hostname` to be the hostname (such as yasmin) and `$host` a resolvable (as in `ssh root@$host`).

To open a shell with required tools installed (such as sops) you can use the nix package manager `nix develop`.


## Prepare sops-nix secrets

define new secrets file for new `$hostname` in `sops.yaml.nix`

```nix
{...}: {
  sops_permissions = with keys; {
    "hosts/$hostname.yml$" = [ ];
    ...
  };
}
```

Changes in sops.yaml.nix have to be applied with

```
inv update-sops-files
```

With that creation rule we can create and populate `hosts/$hostname.yml` secrets with a random root password generated by this command:

```
inv generate-password
echo 'tePO3QGAhAil' | mkpasswd -m sha-512 -s
$6$PPHuMAbzR8hdWmoz$yNKoHqY0GGoXm65AzS4h/VuJVJkORMc68WFk/e3cZ5foJsfxw9LeFBP5s/L5muRZF4/RVn3xYVYPbBGEYo3Xq0
# Add the following secrets
root-password: tePO3QGAhAil
root-password-hash: $6$PPHuMAbzR8hdWmoz$yNKoHqY0GGoXm65AzS4h/VuJVJkORMc68WFk/e3cZ5foJsfxw9LeFBP5s/L5muRZF4/RVn3xYVYPbBGEYo3Xq0
```

Use sops then to add the generated secrets above to the host:

```
sops hosts/$hostname.yml
```

Note that if a rule wasn't created but only changed, run `sops updatekeys path/to.yml` to re-encrypt it.


## Create host keys: SSH and sops/age

Create ssh certificate singed by our CA, so that hosts automatically trust each other.

```console
inv generate-ssh-cert <HOSTNAME>
```

Generate a sops key for `$hostname` (from the ssh identity we generated in the previous step)

```
inv print-age-key $host
```

in `sops.yaml.nix`, add the printed key to `keys` and add `sops_permissions` for `hosts/$hostname.yml`:

```nix
{...}: {
  keys = {
    $hostname = "ageKEYGIBBERISH";
    ...
  };
  sops_permissions = with keys; {
    "hosts/$hostname.yml$" = [ $hostname ];
    ...
  };
}
```

Changes in sops.yaml.nix have to be applied with

```
inv update-sops-files
```


## Prepare NixOS config

Prepare a config for a new host:

If there is no hardware configuratoin yet for your mainboard/server type: Generate a `hardware-configuration.nix` on the server with `nixos-generate-config --dir .` and copy it into `modules/hardware/$hardwarename.nix`.

Write a sane, simple configuration to `hosts/$hostname.nix`:

```nix
{
  pkgs,
  lib,
  ...
}: {
  imports = [
    ../modules/hardware/$hardwarename.nix
  ];

  networking.hostName = "$hostname";

  system.stateVersion = "checkwhatversiontheotherfilesuse";
}
```

Add `hosts/$hostname.nix` in `configurations.nix`.

## Install NixOS

We boot the `github:nix-community/nixos-images/pxe-boot#netboot-installer-nixos-unstable`.
The following script expects the server to be connected to your physical LAN port `$eth0` which will act as a router. 
The script will also print the ip of the server you can connect to via ssh. 

Format the disks and install nixos on the server:

```
inv reformat-install-nixos $host $eth0
```

Finally, note down the MAC addresses of the relevant NICs (and the IPMI) which are printed by install-nixos to give them to the chair admins. 


## Misc: IPMI / UEFI

IPMI administration page in your browser and set the decrypted IPMI login to the credentials defined in `sops secrets.yml`.

In this step you try to find sane IPMI and UEFI settings.

Make sure the system is booted into EFI:

```
[root@nixos:~]# mount | grep efivars
efivarfs on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars type efivarfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
```

Also make sure to enable IPMI serial over lan (run `nix-shell -p ipmitool` on the same machine):

```console
ipmitool sol set privilege-level admin
ipmitool sol set force-encryption false
ipmitool sol set enabled true
ipmitool sol payload enable
```

Some motherboards might use a different channel instead of the default `0`, append some other number
i.e. `1` to each command than

```
ipmitool sol set privilege-level admin 1
ipmitool sol set force-encryption false 1
ipmitool sol set enabled true 1
ipmitool sol payload enable 1
```

Also make sure IPMI over lan is enabled in the BMC website and Serial over lan
redirection is enabled in the BIOS/firmware setup page (vendor-specific).

## Obsolete: Our pxe boot image


Offer an image via pixie network boot and boot the server from it:

```
nix shell .#netboot-pixie-core --command "sudo netboot-pixie-core"
```

Given that your ssh key is in `module/users.nix`, you may connect now via `ssh root@$host` to check out `lsblk` or fix internet connectivity. 
Take care that your ssh-agent is working for later inv commands to work.
