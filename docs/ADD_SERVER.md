# Setting up new hosts

Here we assume `$hostname` to be the hostname (such as yasmin) and `$host` a resolvable (as in `ssh root@$host`).

To open a shell with required tools installed (such as sops) you can use the nix package manager `nix develop`.


## First Steps

First, establish a direct connection (1 to 1, ideally no switch) with the server and set up your machine as a gateway. 
On NixOS you can use the module described here [dnsmasq.nix](DNSMASQ.md).

On Ubuntu you can follow the instructions described [here](DNSMASQ_UBUNTU.md).

Then go to the IPMI administration page in your browser and set the decrypted IPMI login to the credentials defined in `sops secrets.yml`.

## PXEBoot


Offer an image via pixie network boot and boot the server from it:

```
nix shell .#netboot-pixie-core --command "sudo netboot-pixie-core"
```

Given that your ssh key is in `module/users.nix`, you may connect now via `ssh root@$host` to check out `lsblk` or fix internet connectivity. 
Take care that your ssh-agent is working for later inv commands to work. 


## IPMI / UEFI

In this step you try to find sane IPMI and UEFI settings.

Make sure the system is booted into EFI:

```
[root@nixos:~]# mount | grep efivars
efivarfs on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars type efivarfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
```

Also make sure to enable IPMI serial over lan (run `nix-shell -p ipmitool` on the same machine):

```console
ipmitool sol set privilege-level admin
ipmitool sol set force-encryption false
ipmitool sol set enabled true
ipmitool sol payload enable
```

Some motherboards might use a different channel instead of the default `0`, append some other number
i.e. `1` to each command than

```
ipmitool sol set privilege-level admin 1
ipmitool sol set force-encryption false 1
ipmitool sol set enabled true 1
ipmitool sol payload enable 1
```

Also make sure IPMI over lan is enabled in the BMC website and Serial over lan
redirection is enabled in the BIOS/firmware setup page (vendor-specific).

## SSH CA

Create ssh ca certificate, so that hosts automatically trust each other.

```console
inv generate-ssh-cert <HOSTNAME> <IP_OR_HOSTNAME_FOR_SCANNING>
```

then commit the generated certificate: `modules/sshd/certs/<HOSTNAME>-cert.pub`.

## Prepare NixOS config

Prepare a config for a new host:

Generate a sops key for `$hostname` (from the ssh identity of the pxebooted OS)

```
inv print-age-key $host
```

in `sops.yaml.nix`, add the printed key to `keys` and add `sops_permissions` for `hosts/$hostname.yml`:

```nix
keys = {
  $hostname = "ageKEYGIBBERISH";
  ...
};
sops_permissions = with keys; {
  "hosts/$hostname.yml$" = [ $hostname ];
  ...
};
```

Changes in sops.yaml.nix have to be applied with

```
nix2yaml sops.yaml.nix > .sops.yaml
```

With that creation rule we can create and populate `hosts/$hostname.yml` secrets with a random root password generated by this command:

```
inv generate-password
echo 'tePO3QGAhAil' | mkpasswd -m sha-512 -s
$6$PPHuMAbzR8hdWmoz$yNKoHqY0GGoXm65AzS4h/VuJVJkORMc68WFk/e3cZ5foJsfxw9LeFBP5s/L5muRZF4/RVn3xYVYPbBGEYo3Xq0
# Add the following secrets
root-password: tePO3QGAhAil
root-password-hash: $6$PPHuMAbzR8hdWmoz$yNKoHqY0GGoXm65AzS4h/VuJVJkORMc68WFk/e3cZ5foJsfxw9LeFBP5s/L5muRZF4/RVn3xYVYPbBGEYo3Xq0
```

Use sops than to add the generated secrets above to the host:

```
sops hosts/$hostname.yml
```

Note that if a rule wasn't created but only changed, run `sops updatekeys path/to.yml` to re-encrypt it.

Generate a `hardware-configuration.nix` on the server with `nixos-generate-config --dir .` and copy it into `modules/hardware/$hardwarename.nix`.

Write a sane, simple configuration to `hosts/$hostname.nix`:

```nix
{
  pkgs,
  lib,
  ...
}: {
  imports = [
    ../modules/hardware/$hardwarename.nix
  ];

  networking.hostName = "$hostname";

  system.stateVersion = "checkwhatversiontheotherfilesuse";
}
```

Add `hosts/$hostname.nix` in `configurations.nix`.

Push config to github master branch (becuase the server will pull the commit from there during installation).

## Install NixOS

Format the disk

```
# if machine has nvme 
  inv format-disks --hosts $host  --disk /dev/nvme0n1
# if machine has ssd
  inv format-disks --hosts $host  --disk /dev/sda
```

Install nixOS

```
inv install-nixos --hosts $host  --flakeattr $hostname
```

Finally, note down the MAC addresses of the relevant NICs (and the IPMI) which are printed by install-nixos to give them to the chair admins.
